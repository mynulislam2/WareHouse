                        <h5 className='mt-5'> What is the purpose of jwt?</h5>
                        A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. Itâ€™s an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited amount of data  and is cryptographically signed.
                        JWT can be used as an access token to prevent unwanted access to a protected resource.

                        <h5 className='mt-3'>How Does JWT Work?</h5>
 
Step 1 
 
Client logs in with his/her credentials.
 
Step 2
 
Server generates a Jwt token at server side. 
 
 
Step 3
 
After token generation, the server returns a token in response.
 
Step 4
 
Now, the client sends a copy of the token to validate the token. 

Step 5
 
The server checks JWT token to see if it's valid or not.
 
Step 6

After the token is validated, the server sends a status message to the client.

                    <h5 className='mt-5'>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h5>
                     MongoDB is NoSQL database which is document oriented.NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. It's actually helps JavaScript to run outside of server. It's used in server side development.when someone need a database to store data we can use mongodb.and it is easy to use because it is document oriented.and to connect with MongoDB we need an connector .in this time we can use node .js
